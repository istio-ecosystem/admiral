# Processes

## Releases

Admiral will be released monthly, on the second Wednesday of every month. Intuit engineers will conduct the release.

## Issue Management

We use GitHub issues to track all of our bugs and feature requests. Each issue is assigned a milestone. This is 0.1, 0.2, ..., or 'Nebulous Future'. The milestone indicates when we think the issue should get addressed.

We don't annotate issues with Releases; Milestones are used instead. We don't use GitHub projects at all, that support is disabled for our organization.

## Prioritization

There will be a monthly prioritization meeting where all issues without a milestone are added, either to a future release milestone, or to `Nebulous Future`. We will take thumbs ups and commenter engagement on issues into account in making these prioritization decisions.

If you would like your issue to be prioritized into an earlier release, please comment on the issue with your justification.

If you would like to be included in the prioritization meeting, please reach out in the #admiral channel in [Istio Slack](https://slack.istio.io/)
